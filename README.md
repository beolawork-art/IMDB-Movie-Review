🎬 IMDB Movie Review "Vibe Check" Dashboard
📝 Project Overview
I built a full-scale data project to analyze 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB. This project shows how people’s feelings (sentiment) can be tracked using data.

🛠️ The "Pro" Tool Stack
SQL: I used this to store and sort the giant list of 50,000 reviews so they were easy to work with.

Python: I used this as my "Cleaning Machine" to strip away boring words (like "the" and "and") so only the important movie words remained.

Power BI: I used this to build the interactive dashboard and the "Sentiment Buttons."

📊 What’s Inside?
The Vibe Chart (Pie Chart): Shows the 50/50 split between good and bad reviews.

The Big Number: A card showing the total 50,000 reviews analyzed.

The Snippet Scoreboard: A bar chart that changes based on your "Vibe" selection.

🔑 How to use the Dashboard
🟢 Button 1 (Good Reviews): Shows the top phrases from people who liked the movie.

🔴 Button 0 (Bad Reviews): Shows the top phrases from people who did not like the movie.
